Thyroid Disease Detection



Objective Statement:
The primary goal of this project is to employ machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of thyroid disorder detection. By utilizing advanced algorithms and data analytics, the aim is to develop a robust system capable of analyzing diverse medical data, including thyroid function tests and imaging results. The main focus is on creating a machine learning-based solution that can aid healthcare professionals in the early and accurate identification of thyroid disorders, leading to timely interventions and enhanced patient outcomes.

Thyroid Detection Dataset Overview:
The Thyroid Detection dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and accessible on Kaggle, consists of 9172 observations with 31 attributes. The dataset is intended for the development and evaluation of machine learning models for detecting thyroid disorders. Each observation represents a patient, and the attributes include demographic information, medical history, laboratory test results, and the target variable indicating the presence of hyperthyroidism.

Key Attributes:
1. Demographic Information:
Age: Age of the patient (integer).
Sex: Gender identification of the patient (string).
2. Medical History:
On_thyroxine: Boolean indicating whether the patient is on thyroxine.
Query_on_thyroxine: Boolean indicating queries regarding thyroxine usage.
On_antithyroid_meds: Boolean indicating whether the patient is on antithyroid medications.
Sick: Boolean indicating whether the patient is sick.
Pregnant: Boolean indicating whether the patient is pregnant.
Thyroid_surgery: Boolean indicating whether the patient has undergone thyroid surgery.
I131_treatment: Boolean indicating whether the patient is undergoing I131 treatment.
Query_hypothyroid: Boolean indicating the patient's belief of having hypothyroidism.
Query_hyperthyroid: Boolean indicating the patient's belief of having hyperthyroidism.
Lithium: Boolean indicating whether the patient uses lithium.
Goitre: Boolean indicating whether the patient has goitre.
Tumor: Boolean indicating whether the patient has a tumor.
Hypopituitary: Float value indicating a condition related to the hyperpituitary gland.
Psych: Boolean indicating a psychological condition.
3. Laboratory Test Results:
TSH_measured: Boolean indicating whether TSH was measured.
TSH: Float value representing the TSH level in the blood.
T3_measured: Boolean indicating whether T3 was measured.
T3: Float value representing the T3 level in the blood.
TT4_measured: Boolean indicating whether TT4 was measured.
TT4: Float value representing the TT4 level in the blood.
T4U_measured: Boolean indicating whether T4U was measured.
T4U: Float value representing the T4U level in the blood.
FTI_measured: Boolean indicating whether FTI was measured.
FTI: Float value representing the FTI level in the blood.
TBG_measured: Boolean indicating whether TBG was measured.
TBG: Float value representing the TBG level in the blood.
4. Other Attributes:
Referral_source: String indicating the source of patient referral.
Target: String indicating the medical diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
Patient_id: String representing a unique identifier for each patient.
